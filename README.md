# lombacovid_prediction
Attempt to predict the number of hospitalized according to the historical series of positives / swabs with a regressive approach with Machine Learning algorithms.

# Data
The data (story.csv) of the historical series of hospitalized patients and of the positive / swab ratio were recovered through a script created by [Stefano Martire](https://github.com/virtualmartire); they can be visualized on this [page](https://github.com/virtualmartire/lombacovid). Currently, these data are visible on the website [lombacovid](https://www.lombacovid.it/)
